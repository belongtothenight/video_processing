# src/IMAGE

Image processing methods are tested with these code, and later implement into src/VIDEO codes.<\br>

Workflow:

1. Use Matlab and implement in [DIP_Code](https://github.com/belongtothenight/DIP_Code)
2. Use Python and implement in [video_processing/src/image](https://github.com/belongtothenight/video_processing/tree/main/src/image)
3. Combine and convert to CLI with python in [video_processing/src/video](https://github.com/belongtothenight/video_processing/tree/main/src/video)
